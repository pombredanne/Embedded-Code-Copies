I have opted to favour detection rate over false positive reduction. I will probably change this in the future if I push the list into distributions.

Also, some of the package names are problematic, eg compat-expat1 versus expat. Some package names are completely wrong.

In addition, I have not built a complete dependency list when identifying fixed versions, ie I have only looked at the immediate dependencies. Before pushing out to distributions, I will calculate the full list, but it's time consuming in my implementation.

Finally, it sometimes gets the relationship between embedded package and packages, eg libpng. This seems hard to solve completely, and I might have to employ a greater number of bizarre heuristics.
