A list of Linux packages that embed code from other projects.

Debian already maintained such a list [1], but this work helped improve their coverage.
Fedora are now incorporating a list on their wiki [2] based on this work.

About 30 security vulnerabilities in Debian and Fedora were found based on this work.
